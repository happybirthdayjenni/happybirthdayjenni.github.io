                    I remember when we had that scare at the beginning of winter break, we were on the phone, and you
                    said I should call more often. It was great to hear that you wanted to call while we were away,
                    because I still wasn't fully sure where we stood. I knew at least you liked me enough to want to
                    talk to me when we were apart. We called every other day, and I always looked forward to the calls.
                    I was also a little worried, because I knew I was the type of person to jump into relationships too
                    quickly. Anyway, we talked about a weekend road trip and I was so excited to do that. I spent so
                    much time trying to find things to do
                    and plan out the prefect day, but it just ended up being so damn cold that weekend that we could
                    barely walk outside for 10 minutes without freezing. It
                    still was one of the best weekends I've had, and I'm so glad we decided to do it.
