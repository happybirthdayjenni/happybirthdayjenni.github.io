          So this is where things were supposed to BEGIN begin. Things really started in the winter quarter, though. I
          saw you around at Sarge working between classes. It's probably pretty creepy to remember this, but i promise
          it's just because I have a good memory. Anyway, I thought you were pretty cute, but obviously you were
          studying and I didn't want to interrupt. Then you came to a DX/DZ BP night and I played a game with you.
          I asked if you were the person who studied at Sarge between classes. You said you were. I was excited to
          finally have talked to you for a little bit. When you left, I
          was talking to a couple other guys and we all agreed you were really cute, so
          naturally I assumed you were well out of my league. Then, at winter formal, I
          didn't bring a date, and Emma said I should have brought her pledge daughter, and I thought "Oh yeah that'd
          be a great idea, I'll maybe do that for the next event". Then Relay rolled around and at this point most of my
          friends knew I think you're really cute, so they tried to get me to talk to you so I can ask you to Horse
          Prom. Of course I chicken out and don't really talk for you, aside from I think one interaction. I remember
          overhearing you say you wouldn't
          change your last name if you get married, so I ask what your last name is and you say "Hutson". That was about
          that, moral of the story, I chickened out the first time we could've really interacted.
