                    I think it was around formal time when I realized that we really don't have a lot of together before
                    the summer. I
                    tried to spend as much time with you as possible to make the most of what we had left. I cherished
                    every moment we spent together, and
                    though I think we did a great job making the most of the time we had, I wish I could go back and do
                    it again, better. You make me so happy and are so nice to be around. I love being with you. </br>
                    Jenni I really like you and wish I could be with you all the time. I hope
                    you know how much you mean to me and how much I love you, because it's a lot. I'm sorry I'm terrible
                    with words and unoriginal with the website, but I hope maybe you can see that I'm thinking of you
                    constantly and
                    really really REALLY like you. I hope you have a brilliant birthday, and I hope you enjoy the
                    weighted blanket as my replacement while I'm gone. I love you and <a
