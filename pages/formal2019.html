                    I think right about here I realized that we really don't have a lot of together before the summer. I
                    tried to spend as much time with you as possible. I cherish every moment we spent together, and
                    though I think we did a great job making the most of the time we had, I wish I could go back and do
                    it again, better. </br> Jenni I really like you and wish I could be with you all the time. I hope
                    you know how much you mean to me and how much I love you, because it's a lot. I'm sorry I'm terrible
                    with words and unoriginal, but I hope maybe this shows that I'm thinking of you constantly and
                    really really like you. I hope you have a brilliant birthday. I'll see you soon!
