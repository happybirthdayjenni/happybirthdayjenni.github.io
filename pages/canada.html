                    Now this one <i>was</i> a huge milestone in our relationship. I wasn't near as nervous as I probably
                    should've been to spend a whole week nonstop with you. I can't spend a whole week with anyone in my
                    family without having real problems with them. But damn this was a great vacation. Obviously we had
                    a moment or two when we got frustrated with each other, but what is great about us is that we can
                    get through those moments, and talk about them and grow from them. I love that I grow so much when
                    I'm with you. I also get chills <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyIGlUoTh9I"> when I'm with
                        you</a>. But anyway, Canada was a great time and that was when I really felt like this is
                    something really special as we grew closer over the week. It was also the subject of my first
                    journal entries, as I was just trying to recap
                    the whole week so I wouldn't forget anything from that week. I honestly can't think of a better week
                    I've had
                    in my whole life.
