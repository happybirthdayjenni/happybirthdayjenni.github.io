                    So In chapter they say that horse prom is a fun event where we dress up obnoxiously and go to the
                    races. The next thing they say is that it is a very long event, and definitely not a good first date
                    event. So naturally I invite someone I barely know by asking them over Facebook messanger before we
                    were even Facebook friends. I remember sending the message, realizing it was kinda creepy, and
                    expecting a no. Fortunately you said yes. I brought my iced tea liquor mixed with lemonade vitamin
                    waters. I didn't think they were very strong, but it hit you pretty well, and you were talking
                    nonstop about your class where you were reading Virginia Woolf. I really had no idea what you were
                    talking about, but I loved how into it you were and how passionate you were. At the races, I
                    remember a lot of small talk, but it actually went a lot better than I would have expected. Somehow,
                    I could maintain a conversation with this pretty girl without making a complete fool of myself.
