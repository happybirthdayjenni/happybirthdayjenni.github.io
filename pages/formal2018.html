                    I asked you to Formal after eecs 211 class and I remember still feeling pretty nervous about asking
                    you. I was really excited that you came. I actually
                    don't remember a whole lot from formal, I just remember that once shit hit the fan, I was more than
                    happy to take care of you. Then
                    a week or two after formal, it was Dillo Day. I don't have a picture of us from Dillo, so I didn't
                    make it it's own thing. I felt a little bad at the time for spending most of the day with you
                    instead of my friends, but
                    I don't regret it all. It was a lot of fun, and where we had our first kiss. I do just want to say,
                    even though you invited me over to take a nap and lay in
                    your bed with you, I was the one to actually lean over and initiate our first kiss.
                    And after Dillo, we went to that "after party" that a senior was trying to make happen, and quickly
                    noped out of there. I walked you home as it started raining and said good night. It was pouring on
                    the walk back, but it didn't bother me much after such a great day.
