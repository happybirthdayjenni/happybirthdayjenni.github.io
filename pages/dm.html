                    After all the jokes that we made about it, we never did have sex in the tent. Winter quarter with
                    you was amazing. I was really worried that we wouldn't have a lot of time together becuase we would
                    be too busy and wouldn't have to spend time together to work on EECS 213 homework, but we made it
                    work so well. I loved the mornings after I spent the nights in your room and the times you made me
                    late to class. DM was in winter quarter honestly wasn't a
                    huge milestone in our relationship, though I enjoyed dancing with you and taking that nap after
                    block 3. I mostly just wanted to put this
                    picture of you in here. TBH a lot of the things I put in here aren't huge milestones in our
                    relationships, just things I have
                    photos of us from.
