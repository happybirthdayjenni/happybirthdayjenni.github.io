                    You remember how the year started and how I asked you out after brunch. Based off youre response I
                    figured nothing would happen between us, but luckily we were in the same EECS 213 class. I was so
                    releived when I asked if you had a partner and you said we should be partners. I was so worried I
                    was going to be with some rando, but also, it meant that maybe things wouldn't have to be over
                    between us. I'd have a whole quarter for us to get to know each other, and that made me happy. But
                    god DAMM this class sucked. The homeworks were
                    painfully tedious and difficult, but I still always looked forward to doing them, because it
                    meant time with you. It was amazing getting to know you better and seeing how smart and passionate
                    you were, though not passionate for 213. As they say, mutual struggle creates bonds, and that
                    clearly holds for us.
